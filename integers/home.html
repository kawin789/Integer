            <h1>Welcome To Integers !</h1>
        </center>

    <pre><p>
                 In the year 1996, a clandestine organization known as UNSC unveiled groundbreaking initiative named "Integers"in
        India. This initiative was not an ordinary one, but a symbol of hope, resilience, and unity, drawing its inspiration
        from a team of legendary heroes known as the Avengers. At the core of Integers was a figure of immense mystery and power
        named "DISPLAY," a sentient screen with the ability to foresee and manipulate outcomes across time and space.

        DISPLAY, the head of Integers, was a digital marvel, housing the collective wisdom of the world's greatest minds. The
        purpose of Integers was to defend humanity against threats too great for ordinary forces to handle. To accomplish this
        monumental task, DISPLAY assembled six elite squads, each specializing in unique forms of combat and defense. These
        squads were known as the Iron Squad, Shield Squad, Web Squad, Gun Squad, Tech Squad, and Quantum Squad.

        The Iron Squad, inspired by the tenacity and ingenuity of the original Iron Man, was equipped with cutting-edge
        exoskeleton suits. These suits enhanced their physical capabilities and provided them with unparalleled firepower. The
        Shield Squad, drawing from the legacy of Captain America, was a group of highly skilled tacticians and hand-to-hand
        combat experts, each carrying indestructible shields made from a mysterious alloy.

        The Web Squad, in homage to the agility and quick thinking of Spider-Man, consisted of nimble operatives who used
        advanced web-like grappling hooks and gadgets. They were the eyes and ears of Integers, capable of infiltrating any
        stronghold. The Gun Squad, a tribute to the deadly precision of the Black Widow and Hawkeye, was a unit of marksmen and
        weapons experts, able to turn the tide of any battle with their accuracy and strategic prowess.

        The Tech Squad, a reflection of the genius of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, was responsible for creating and maintaining
        the advanced technology that powered Integers. From developing new weapons to enhancing the capabilities of their
        comrades, they were the backbone of the organization. Lastly, the Quantum Squad, inspired by the time-bending adventures
        of Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, specialized in manipulating time and space, providing crucial support in missions that
        defied the natural laws.

        Each squad, while specialized, was trained to work in perfect harmony with the others, ensuring that Integers could
        tackle any threat from any angle. DISPLAY, with its vast array of information and strategic capabilities, coordinated
        their efforts, making sure that no move was wasted, and no opportunity missed.

        Together, these squads formed an unstoppable force, ready to defend the world from threats both terrestrial and cosmic.
        The creation of Integers marked a new era of heroism and collaboration, proving that even in the digital age, the spirit
        of courage and unity could prevail against the darkest of adversaries.

        The story of Integers continues to unfold, with new challenges and adventures awaiting DISPLAY and its valiant squads.
        Each member knows that their strength lies not just in their individual prowess, but in their unwavering commitment to
        each other and to the mission of protecting humanity.

        As the world evolves, so does the legacy of Integers, ever ready to stand against the forces that threaten peace and
        justice. The tale of DISPLAY and its squads serves as a reminder that with unity, innovation, and determination, any
        challenge can be overcome, and any foe can be defeated.
